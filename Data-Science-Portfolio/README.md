## 🚀 How to run locally

```bash
# Clone your portfolio (replace with your GitHub repo URL after you push)
git clone <your-repo-url>.git
cd <repo-folder>

# Choose a project, install deps, and open the notebook
cd Zomato_Analysis           # or any project folder listed above
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

> All projects are **notebook‑only** (no web apps) for clean reproducibility. Each folder includes a focused `requirements.txt`.
